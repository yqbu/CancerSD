# CancerSD: Cancer Subtype Diagnosis with Limited Multi-Omics Data
CancerSD is an end-to-end model designed for cancer subtype diagnosis using limited weakly-paired multi-omics data

The diagnosis of cancer subtypes is a prerequisite for precise treatment. Compared to single-omics data-based diagnostic solutions, multi-omics data fusion-based approaches often provide a more accurate and authentic diagnosis. However, they build on the requisite of sufficient samples with completely-paired omics data, which is challenging to obtain in clinical applications. In this study, \yqbu{a novel integrative model (\methodname{}) is proposed for cancer subtype diagnosis using limited samples with weakly-paired multi-omics data.} \methodname{} constructs tailored contrastive learning and masking-and-reconstruction tasks to effectively impute the missing omics, enabling flexible and accurate cancer subtype diagnosis. To cope with scarce clinical samples, it introduces a category-level contrastive loss and extends the meta-learning framework to mine specific knowledge from external datasets. Experiments on benchmark datasets show that \methodname{} not only gives accurate diagnosis, but also maintains a high authenticity and good interpretability. \methodname{} identifies important molecular characteristics associated with cancer subtypes, and it defines the integrated \methodname{} score that can serve as an independent predictive factor for patient prognosis.
